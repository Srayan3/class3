****Inserting data to the Database and Fetching them explaind****

In this project the first file "conn.php" we used it to make a connection between our code and the database
Then the second file "form.php" we made a form that send the information you give to the 4th file "process.php"
"process.php" collects the data from "form.php" and converts them into a string then sends it to the database my execution some queries
at last the third file "index.php" shows or we can say fetch or prints the stored data in the database.

And the SQL file that is given should be imported to a database that you create(name can be anything) and then you have to change the $database name in "conn.php"
